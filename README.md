# DepthKopy: Read-depth based copy number estimation

This is a placeholder repo for DepthKopy - coming soon!

DepthKopy applies the same single-copy read depth estimate as [DepthSizer](https://github.com/slimsuite/depthsizer) to estimate the copy number of different gene regions in a slightly modified version of the approach used in the basenji genome paper.
